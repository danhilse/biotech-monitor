The company's HBV-cure program is aimed at increasing the current low cure rate for patients with HBV and is pursuing multiple drug candidates that inhibit multiple steps of the HBV lifecycle. Assembly has discovered several novel core protein Allosteric Modulators, which are small molecules that directly target and allosterically modulate the HBV core protein.

The company offers a diverse array of drugs with its highest revenue generator, Dupixent, representing just over 20% of total sales, but profits are shared with Regeneron. Just over 40% of total revenue comes from the United States and 25% from Europe. Emerging markets represent the majority of the remainder of revenue.",
