However, the company's decision in late 2019 to pull back from the cardio-metabolic area will likely reduce the firm's footprint in this large therapeutic area. The company offers a diverse array of drugs with its highest revenue generator, Dupixent, representing just over 20% of total sales, but profits are shared with Regeneron. Just over 40% of total revenue comes from the United States and 25% from Europe. Emerging markets represent the majority of the remainder of revenue.",
